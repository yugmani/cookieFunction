# cookieFunction
1. Create a div with an id of "greeting" in a HTML file. 
2. Create an external javascript file and save it. 
3. Create a function named set_it() that will set a cookie. Set the expiration to a future date. Allow the viewer to enter a name in a prompt and then use the viewer's entry in the cookie.
4. Create a function named read_it() that will check whether the cookie exists and, if so, read the cookie and write the name on the page in the following format ( replace ```<name>``` with the name read from the cookie);
```Welcome, <name>!```

5. If the cookie exists, call the read_it() function. If the cookie doesn't exist, call the set_it() followed by the read_it() function.
